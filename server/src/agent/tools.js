     * `from` names the field of the result to read, and the extractor unwraps
     * the Table API's `{ display_value, value }` cell. That unwrapping is
     * exactly why an output must be DECLARED rather than scraped: `.sys_id` on
     * a raw row is an object, not an id, and a plan should not have to know
     * the transport's shape to say "the record this read found".
     *
     * Only `sys_id` is declared, because only `sys_id` exists on every table
     * this tool can read. Declaring `number` here would make a plan's validity
     * depend on which table it happened to name, and a reference to an
     * undeclared output is refused at validation rather than at run time.
     *
     * PHASE 14 REVISITS THAT, NARROWLY, AND ACCEPTS THE COST IT NAMES.
     *
     * A diagnosis has to walk from a record to the records it points at —
     * incident to caller, to assignment group, to configuration item — and
     * §15 requires that walk to use the Phase 12 resolver rather than any
     * ad-hoc substitution. Reaching a reference field's value is the only way
     * to do that, so these four are declared.
     *
     * The objection above is real and is not being waved away: on a table that
     * has no `caller_id`, a plan referencing `step_1.result.caller_id`
     * validates and then fails when it runs. That is a genuine downgrade from
     * plan-time refusal to run-time refusal, and it is accepted for exactly one
     * reason — it still FAILS CLOSED. `extractOutputs` omits an output whose
     * field is absent, the consumer gets `missing_step_output`, and the step
     * does not run. Nothing is substituted and nothing is guessed; the refusal
     * simply arrives later than it would for a misspelled output name.
     *
     * What is NOT declared is anything table-specific that is not a reference:
     * no `number`, no `state`, no `short_description`. Those would carry the
     * same cost without buying the traversal that made it worth paying.
     *
     * Each of these holds a sys_id when it is set, which is why the type is
     * `sys_id` and why the extractor's cell-unwrapping produces an identity
     * rather than a display name. An EMPTY reference field yields `''`, and
     * Phase 12 already refuses that with `null_required_output` — so an
     * unassigned incident cannot carry a blank identity into a later read.

   * WI-ACL-1 — ACL AUTHORING. Model-callable, but never model-executed.
   *
   * These three tools are the ONLY ACL write verbs, and none of them writes
   * anything. Their `execute` is unreachable: `describeWrite` produces a
   * `(sys_security_acl, create|update|delete)` descriptor, `isGatedDescriptor`
   * classifies it as gated, and `handleGatedElevation` intercepts the call
   * before `executeTool` is ever reached (orchestrator.js). The actual write
   * happens inside one elevated execution, as an atomic ACL + role-link unit,
   * after a human approves a card that names the rule in plain language.
   *
   * So the model can ASK for an ACL. It cannot author one, cannot elevate,
   * cannot reach the shim, and cannot fall back to `create_record` — that route
   * produces the same gated descriptor and lands in the same gate.
   *
   * The `execute` bodies exist only to make that unreachability LOUD rather
   * than implicit: if the interception is ever removed or reordered, these
   * throw instead of quietly performing an un-elevated write that would
   * silently no-op and leave the user believing access had changed.
