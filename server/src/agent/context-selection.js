/**
 * PHASE 2 — RECOGNISING WHAT A REQUEST IS ABOUT, AND SELECTING FOR IT.
 *
 * Pure functions over data. No I/O, no database, no instance, no model. Every
 * function here is total and deterministic: the same inputs produce the same
 * output on every call and in every process, which is what makes a context
 * selection something a test can pin down rather than observe.
 *
 * THE CLASSIFIER RECOGNISES; IT DOES NOT GUESS.
 *
 * That distinction is the safety property of this file. A guess would be a
 * scoring function with a threshold — "this looks 0.6 flow-ish" — and the
 * failure mode of a threshold is that it always returns something, so a request
 * it has never seen still gets a confident narrow answer and a turn that cannot
 * finish. This does the opposite: it looks for explicit, unambiguous evidence
 * of a domain, and when it finds none it says so and the caller falls back to
 * the whole surface.
 *
 * The signals are word-boundary matches on terms that name a ServiceNow
 * artifact class. They are not synonyms or stems of general English: "flow" is
 * a signal, "flowing" is not; "acl" is a signal, "access" alone is not, because
 * "I cannot access the record" is not an access-control request.
 *
 * WHEN IN DOUBT IT WIDENS. Several domains matched means the union of all of
 * them, never a ranking that picks one. A request that says "add an SLA to the
 * incident flow" is genuinely about three things, and the correct answer is
 * three capabilities rather than the strongest one.
 */

/**
 * Domain signals, as anchored regular expressions.
 *
 * Every entry earns its place by naming a ServiceNow noun. The comments record
 * why the narrow ones are narrow — each is a phrase that would otherwise
 * misfire on ordinary English in a ServiceNow conversation.
