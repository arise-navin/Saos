 * watcher force-kills the old process and starts the new one immediately —
 * before the OS has released the listening socket. The new process then got
 * `EADDRINUSE` as an unhandled 'error' event on the http server, which the

 * printed "Failed running 'src/index.js'. Waiting for file changes before
 * restarting..." and the API server stayed DEAD until someone touched another
 * file.
 *
 * From the browser that reads exactly as the reported symptom, in this order:
 *   [vite] http proxy error: /api/...  Error: read ECONNRESET      <- the kill
 *   [vite] http proxy error: /api/...  AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]  <- after
 *
 * Two things were wrong and both are fixed here:
 *   1. a transient port race was terminal. It is now retried, because the
 *      socket is released within a few hundred milliseconds and waiting for it
 *      is the whole fix;
 *   2. a genuinely occupied port died with a Node stack trace naming
 *      `net.js`. It now says which port, and what to do about it.
 *
 * The retry window is deliberately short. It is long enough for a watcher
 * handoff and far too short to mask a second server someone actually left
 * running — that still fails, loudly, with instructions.
