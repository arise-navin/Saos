/**
 * Server-side execution harness for TRIGGERLESS artifacts.
 *
 * A record-triggered flow can be proven by creating a record that matches its
 * trigger (see fluent.js `verify`). A SUBFLOW has no trigger, so there is
 * nothing to create — it has to be *called*. Everything below exists to make
 * that call from outside the instance, and to leave nothing behind.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED (docs/fluent-research.md §32), not assumed:
 *
 *   1. `sn_fd.FlowAPI` is real but server-side only, exactly as §11 said. What
 *      §11 got wrong was the conclusion: reaching it does NOT require a
 *      Scripted REST API. A one-shot `sysauto_script` (Scheduled Script
 *      Execution) with run_type='once' and run_start in the past is created
 *      over the ordinary Table API and RUNS WITHIN SECONDS — measured at ~2s
 *      from insert to execution across every probe.
 *
 *   2. The runner's real signature, confirmed against the live instance:
 *
 *        sn_fd.FlowAPI.getRunner()
 *          .subflow('<scope>.<internal_name>')
 *          .inBackground()            // or .inForeground()
 *          .withInputs({ ... })
 *          .run()
 *
 *      The result object answers getContextId() and getOutputs().
 *      The scope prefix is MANDATORY: an unqualified name is resolved as
 *      global.<name> and the runner throws
 *      "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: flow object for 'global.x' does not exist".
 *
 *   3. inBackground vs inForeground, and why this ships background:
 *      - foreground THROWS on a failing subflow
 *        (FlowObjectAPIException: The current operation ended in state: ERROR...),
 *        which loses the contextId the caller was about to store;
 *      - background returns in 14-29ms with a valid contextId, and the failure
 *        shows up as `sys_flow_context.state = ERROR` with a full
 *        `error_message` — the same vocabulary the record-triggered runner
 *        already speaks. A subflow that pauses therefore times out as a FAIL
 *        with its last observed state instead of hanging a scheduled job.
 *
 *   4. Outputs ARE capturable, from the platform's own storage:
 *      `sys_flow_runtime_value` where context=<contextId> and type='output'
 *      carries a JSON map of every output. getOutputs() in background mode
 *      returns {} (the flow has not run yet), so the runtime-value table is
 *      the authority, not the script.
 *
 *   5. The job's return channel is ONE deletable row. gs.info was rejected
 *      after measuring that syslog cannot be deleted over REST (403), which
 *      would make "clean up every test record" a lie. A namespaced
 *      `sys_user_preference` row round-trips a 65,000-char value and deletes
 *      cleanly.
 *
 * This module is deliberately artifact-agnostic: `runServerScript` runs ANY
 * server-side script and hands back a JSON report, so v0.4's fix-script and
 * script-include verification calls the same code path rather than growing a
 * second copy of the job/sink/cleanup dance.
 *
 * INJECTION: every value that reaches the generated script is either a
 * validated identifier (the qualified flow name), a hex id we minted, or is
 * embedded through jsLiteral(). Nothing is concatenated raw.
 */

/*
 * The sink is a `sys_user_preference` NAME, not a scoped artifact.
 *
 * It used to be namespaced under the application's scope name, which coupled a
 * transient preference row to the app scope for no reason — and broke the
 * harness when that scope was renamed. Nothing about this row belongs to the
 * app scope: it is created, read once and deleted inside a single call.
 * Namespacing it under the product removes the coupling entirely, rather than
 * swapping one scope literal for another.

 * ── M-1: WHY THERE IS A SECOND RETURN CHANNEL ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * MEASURED on dev428633, 2026-08-31, after a trivial one-shot probe "timed out"
 * at 93.7s against a ~2s baseline. The job was not slow and the scheduler was
 * not asleep. Instrumenting the generated script with gs.info showed:
 *
 *   NFQ… scope=x_2002152_nwforge
 *   NFQ… isValid=true canCreate=true canWrite=true canRead=true
 *   NFQ… afterSet name=[null] value=[null]      <-- the write did NOTHING
 *   NFQ… insert=48997ce573cfc390a40ef7303ab8b747 lastErr=null
 *   NFQ… reread name=[null] value=[null]
 *
 * The job ran in UNDER FIVE SECONDS. What failed was the return channel:
 *
 *   1. A `sysauto_script` created over the Table API is born in the REST
 *      session's current application, which is this app's scope — and the scope
 *      cannot be overridden on the insert (trap #69; client.js proves it by
 *      refusing). So the job runs SCOPED.
 *   2. `sys_user_preference` is owned by `global` with `update_access = false`.
 *      A scoped script's field writes to it are DISCARDED IN SILENCE:
 *      `canWrite()` answers true, `setValue` is a no-op, `insert()` returns a
 *      real sys_id and `getLastErrorMessage()` is null. Every signal says
 *      success; the row lands with an empty name and an empty value.
 *   3. The harness then polled for `name=<sinkName>`, never matched, and timed
 *      out blaming the scheduler — the opposite of the truth.
 *   4. Cleanup queried by that same name, found nothing, and reported
 *      `sinkDeleted: true, leftovers: []` while a blank-named row STAYED on the
 *      instance. The leak was invisible for the same reason the payload was.
 *
 * So the wrapper now (a) says out loud that it started, (b) PROVES the sink row
 * round-tripped instead of trusting `insert()`, and (c) falls back to syslog —
 * the one channel a scoped script demonstrably can write — when it did not.
 * syslog cannot be deleted over REST, which is why it was rejected as the
 * primary channel in §32 and why it is still only the fallback: the ordinary
 * path leaves nothing behind, and the fallback trades a few undeletable log
 * lines for an answer instead of a wrong diagnosis and a silent leak.
