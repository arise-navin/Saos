 * FLOW GATE MODE - what a failed LOCAL check does
 *
 * The pre-build gates are two different kinds of thing wearing one name, and
 * the difference decides whether relaxing them is even coherent:
 *
 *   OURS (local): promised literals, blueprint fidelity, artifact type and
 *   subflow contract, subflow reuse, trigger strategy, flow design. Every one
 *   is a judgement WE make about generated source. Relaxing them lets a
 *   candidate the platform would accept reach the instance, which is exactly
 *   what an implementation phase needs: the authoring path gets exercised
 *   instead of the linter.
 *
 *   THE PLATFORM'S: `$id` identity. `keys.ts` is a flat, project-wide map, and
 *   a duplicate key aborts `now-sdk build`. Relaxing it unblocks nothing; it
 *   trades a one-second diagnostic for a multi-minute build failure naming a
 *   sys_id nobody wrote. It blocks in every mode.
 *
 * 'advisory' every check still RUNS, every diagnostic is still emitted and
 *   returned on `gateAdvisories`, and none of ours stops the candidate.
 * 'enforce' (default) a local finding rejects the candidate and spends an
 *   attempt. This is the production mode: source with literal/design findings
 *   must not reach an instance.
 *
 * Set `NOWFORGE_FLOW_GATES=advisory` only for local diagnostics. Nothing here
 * deletes or weakens a rule, and every test that pins gate behaviour calls the
 * linters directly, so they stay pinned.

 * `now-sdk install` → read-back through flows.detail().
 *
 * Hygiene invariants — these are load-bearing, because `now-sdk install`
 * deploys the ENTIRE application every time (there is no per-file deploy):
 *   (a) only build-validated sources may sit in src/fluent when install runs;
 *   (b) a generation candidate that never compiles is deleted before the error
 *       is returned, and the workspace is rebuilt to resync keys.ts. src/ is
 *       snapshotted before each request and diffed after a failure, so this is
 *       an assertion the pipeline reports on, not an intention;
 *   (c) every build/install runs through one serialized queue — concurrent runs
 *       would race on the shared dist/ output and on keys.ts;
 *   (d) one source file per artifact family, named by a deterministic slug, so
 *       regenerating a spec overwrites the same file and Now.ID keeps sys_ids
 *       stable instead of creating duplicates. Within a request every retry
 *       writes one fingerprint-named candidate, so a model that renames the
 *       flow mid-retry cannot strand a second file;
 *   (e) element identity is a PROJECT-WIDE namespace. A Now.ID key already
 *       declared anywhere in src/ is a live record owned by that flow, so every
 *       candidate is validated against every other source before it is built.
 *
 * The CLI is only ever invoked with fixed literal arguments — no user input is
 * ever passed to it — and it is spawned as `node <sdk entry>` rather than
 * through a shell, so there is no command-injection surface. Anything that
 * needs user-supplied values (read-back by name) goes through the REST client.

 *
 *   'unknown'  nothing was derived; no credentials.        NOT ready.
 *   'derived'  the UI config produced usable credentials.  Ready.
 *   'live'     those credentials were PROVEN against the

 *   'failed'   the probe was rejected by the instance.     NOT ready.

 * Readiness was written as `auth.verified === 'derived'`, which quietly meant
 * "ready only while unproven". The deep probe UPGRADES 'derived' to 'live' on
 * success, so `capability({ deep: true })` reported `ok: false` precisely when
 * the credentials had just been proven to work — and with an EMPTY `fixes`
 * array, because nothing had gone wrong to push a fix for.
 *
 * Live 2026-09-02 is what that cost. A deep check returned CLI 4.10.1 present,
 * auth verified 'live', workspace present with 25 sources, `lastInstall.ok:
 * true` from three hours earlier — and `ok: false`. The agent obeyed its own
 * rule C ("Business Rule fallback ONLY when flow_authoring_capability reports
 * ok:false"), told the user native Flow Designer was unavailable, and offered
 * to write a business rule instead of the flow and subflow that had been
 * working all along. The shallow check the UI polls stayed 'derived' and kept
 * saying ok:true, so the page and the agent disagreed with each other.
 *
 * Adding a value to this ladder now means adding it here, where the ordering is
 * written down, rather than to an equality buried in an expression.

const HARD_RULES = `HARD RULES — a violation fails the build:
1. Output ONE complete TypeScript source file and NOTHING else. No prose, no markdown fences, no explanation.
2. Every $id must be Now.ID['snake_case_key'], and keys are a PROJECT-WIDE namespace, not a per-file one: one key = one live record, so a key reused from another flow COLLIDES instead of creating a new element. Every key you write must be unique across the WHOLE project and freshly minted for THIS flow: prefix all of them with a short slug of this flow's name (a \"Vendor Hold Problem\" flow uses vhp_trigger, vhp_create_problem, vhp_if_critical). NEVER copy a key from the syntax examples below (they are prefixed ex_ and are already taken), and NEVER write a literal sys_id as an $id. A Now.ID['__ID_n__'] placeholder in a source you are given is an existing record's identity — keep it exactly, never invent a new one.
3. NEVER assign a data pill to a variable. wfa.dataPill(...) goes inline in an action parameter. Capturing an ACTION RESULT in a const is required and correct.
4. TemplateValue, Time, Duration and Now.ID are globals — using them is fine, importing them is an error.
5. Conditions are encoded queries inside template literals: \`\${wfa.dataPill(x, 'string')}=1\`. No JavaScript, no ==, no &&.
6. Template literals interpolate ONLY in ah_subject and log_message. Never in ah_body, SMS message, or inside TemplateValue({...}).
7. lookUpRecord outputs .Record/.Table; lookUpRecords outputs .Records/.Count — capitalised. createRecord/updateRecord output lowercase .record.
8. Per-action value keys differ: values (createRecord/updateRecord), field_values (createTask/updateMultipleRecords), fields (createOrUpdateRecord). lookUpRecord(s) take table + conditions.
9. If the body never reads params, declare the callback () => { — noUnusedParameters is enforced (TS6133). Scheduled flows always use () =>.
9b. For trigger.record.updated / createdOrUpdated you MUST set trigger_strategy explicitly. Omitting it is not neutral: the platform default 'once' fires once EVER for a record and never again, even after it leaves the condition and re-enters. A request phrased "when a record is updated TO <state>" describes a TRANSITION and wants 'unique_changes'; 'every' fires on every save while the condition holds, which duplicates any record the flow creates.
10. Exactly one wfa.trigger(...) for a Flow; a Subflow has none and must be exported as \`export const\`, with assignSubflowOutputs on every reachable path.
11. waitForCompletion belongs in the subflow INPUTS object (3rd arg), not the instance config (2nd arg).
12. Use the resolved sys_ids given below. If a name was not resolved, match by name in an encoded query — never invent an identifier.`;

/**
 * The extra rules a STANDALONE subflow has to satisfy.
 *
 * A subflow is not "a flow without a trigger": it is a callable unit whose
 * inputs and outputs are a published interface. Each rule below is checked
 * mechanically after generation (subflows.js `lintArtifactType`), so it is
 * stated here in the same words the rejection will use.
 */
const SUBFLOW_RULES = `THIS REQUEST IS FOR A SUBFLOW, NOT A FLOW. Additional hard rules:
S1. Emit exactly one \`export const <camelCaseName> = Subflow({ ... }, (params) => { ... })\` and NOTHING else — no Flow(...), no wfa.trigger(...). A subflow runs because another flow calls it; a triggered artifact is stored by the platform as a flow, not a subflow.
S2. The export is mandatory. Without \`export const\` no other flow can import it, so it can never be called.
S3. Declare the INPUTS the request names, in the config's \`inputs\` object, with column types from '@servicenow/sdk/core': StringColumn, IntegerColumn, BooleanColumn, DateTimeColumn, ReferenceColumn. A reference input MUST carry its table: ReferenceColumn({ label: 'Task', referenceTable: 'task', mandatory: true }).
S4. Every declared input MUST be READ in the body via wfa.dataPill(params.inputs.<name>, '<type>'). An input nothing reads is a parameter the caller can pass with no effect.
S5. Declare an OUTPUT for every value the request says the subflow returns, and assign every one of them with wfa.flowLogic.assignSubflowOutputs({ $id: Now.ID['<key>'] }, params.outputs, { <output>: <value>, ... }) on EVERY reachable path. params.outputs is the second argument, always. An output that is never assigned comes back empty and the caller cannot tell that from a legitimately empty value.
S6. If the request promises nothing back, declare no outputs at all rather than declaring one and leaving it unassigned.`;

 * different things. Read from the SDK 4.10.1 source
 * (sdk-api/dist/flow-activation.js, orchestrator.js), flow activation is a
 * POST-INSTALL TASK, and:
 *
 *   - it runs only AFTER the deployment wait succeeds, inside the same try, so
 *     a deployment timeout means activation was never attempted at all;
 *   - if the endpoint is absent the SDK logs at DEBUG and RETURNS;
 *   - if there is nothing to send it logs "No flows to activate" at DEBUG;
 *   - if it THROWS, `runPostInstallTasks` catches it, logs at DEBUG, and the
 *     install still exits 0.
 *
 * So a clean `now-sdk install` is compatible with zero flows published, and
 * `activation: null` was the same word for "it worked and said nothing",
 * "the endpoint is missing", and "it failed". Three-valued now, with the
 * reason named — and `activation` keeps its old meaning so existing readers

 * environment variable and no config key** that changes it — `now-sdk install

 * the CLI aborts and exits non-zero while the SERVER carries on and finishes.
 *
 * Measured on dev424910, 17 Sep 2026, three installs in a row: every one
 * reported `The deployment request timed out waiting for a response` and every
 * one had completed. Eleven artifacts, all correct, all verified by read-back.
 * Treating that exit code as a verdict is how a successful deploy gets reported
 * to a user as a failure — which is exactly what happened.
 *

 *

 *   absent before, present now      -> it landed
 *   present before, stamp moved     -> it was updated
 *   present before, stamp unchanged -> nothing landed yet; keep waiting
 *
 * Records land progressively while the install runs, and the last one has been
 * seen arriving minutes after the client gave up, so this polls rather than
 * looking once. It never writes, and it never claims success it did not read.

/**
 * Publish one managed flow or subflow, and prove it.
 *
 * ═══ THE GAP THIS CLOSES ═══
 *
 * Measured on dev424910: 33 flows installed, none published. The SDK activates
 * flows as a POST-INSTALL TASK that runs only after its deployment wait
 * succeeds — and that wait is a fixed 300-second client-side abort
 * (sdk-api/dist/connector.js:156) which fired on six of our installs. When it
 * fires, `runPostInstallTasks` is never reached, so nothing was ever published.
 * Worse, when it IS reached and throws, the SDK catches it and logs at DEBUG
 * while the install still exits 0. There was no way to publish a flow from
 * this build, and no way to find out that nothing had been.
 *
 * So the model's only reachable route to "make this flow live" was
 * `update_record` on `sys_hub_flow` — which the policy refuses, correctly, and
 * which would not have worked anyway: `active` without a snapshot is a header
 * claiming to be on with nothing to run. Measured 2026-09-09: the agent tried
 * it three times in one turn. THAT is what this step is for.
 *
 * ═══ WHAT IT DOES, IN ORDER ═══
 *
 *   1. resolve the artifact BY NAME inside the bound scope. A name that
 *      matches nothing, or more than one thing, stops here.
 *   2. confirm it actually shipped through an install, by the one query that
 *      proves it: a `sys_update_version` row for this artifact, `state=current`
 *      and `source_table=sys_upgrade_history`. That combination means an
 *      application install put the record there rather than a UI edit.
 *      REPORTED, NOT REQUIRED — the artifact existing in the scope is the
 *      stronger fact, and refusing on a missing corroboration would refuse a
 *      correct state. `sys_upgrade_history` itself is NOT consulted: measured,
 *      all 60 rows for this app read `complete`, including ones still writing
 *      minutes later, so it cannot decide terminality for anything.
 *   3. ask the platform to publish exactly this artifact.
 *   4. READ THE THREE-WAY PROOF BACK. That is the verdict. What the activation
 *      call reported is recorded beside it and is never mistaken for it.
 *
 * ═══ BOUNDED ═══
 *
 * One attempt. No retry, no second install, no fallback to a header write. A
 * failure returns the mismatch by name so a person can act on it.
 */
/**
 * Resolve ONE managed artifact by name, inside the bound scope only.

  "assertAfterResume": [ { ...same shape as an assert... } ]
}

RULES:
1. setup.payload MUST satisfy the flow's own trigger condition — read the condition out of the source and mirror it exactly, using real sys_ids and real numeric choice VALUES from the live context.
2. Every assertion must test an effect the REQUEST PROMISED (a field the flow writes, a record the flow creates, a note the flow adds).
3. FORBIDDEN: asserting a field that setup.payload itself sets. That is trivially true and proves nothing about the flow. If the request promises "set assigned_to when empty", then setup.payload must NOT set assigned_to, and the assertion checks assigned_to afterwards.
3b. COVER EVERY PROMISE: produce one assertion for EACH observable effect listed under PROMISED EFFECTS below. If three effects are promised, the spec needs three assertions. Asserting fewer than the request promises is incomplete and will be rejected.
3c. UNVERIFIABLE PROMISES — the ONE exception to 3b, and it is checked. A request can promise something this instance has no way to show: the field it would be written to does not exist here, or the value it would be copied from is EMPTY on the record it comes from. Do not fake such an effect, and do not silently drop it either. List it under "unverifiable" with the effect quoted, kind "field_absent" (name the table and the missing field) or "source_empty" (name the table, the field, and the sys_id of the record it would be read from), and a short note. Each excuse is CHECKED against the live instance: if the field turns out to exist, or the value turns out to be non-empty, the excuse is rejected and you must assert the effect instead. Excusing an effect you simply found hard to assert will therefore fail. Use this only when the LIVE INSTANCE CONTEXT or the evidence below shows the effect is impossible here.
4. Use "display" for reference fields and choice fields (a person's name, a group's name); use "value" for raw strings, numbers and journal text.
5. For journal fields (work_notes, comments) assert the distinctive text the flow writes — a substring match is applied.
6. In byQuery you may use the token {{setup.sys_id}}, which is replaced with the created record's sys_id. Use it to find records the flow created (e.g. "parent={{setup.sys_id}}").
6b. {{setup.sys_id}} is the ONLY token, and it works ONLY inside locate.byQuery. NEVER put {{...}} in expect.value or expect.display — nothing substitutes it there, it is compared literally, and it fails a flow that is working. If an expected value is not knowable when you write the spec (a generated number like PRB0012345, a sys_id), do not guess it: move the proof into the LOCATOR. Locate with a query that can only match when the effect happened, then assert a field whose value you DO know. A locator that matches nothing is reported as a failed assertion, so the locator carries the proof.
6d. EXPECTED VALUES ARE LITERAL. Comparison is exact for ordinary fields and containment for journal fields; there are no wildcards and no phrases. Never write "*", "%", "not empty", "any ...", or "<something>" as an expected value. If part of the text is generated (a PRB/INC number, a sys_id, a timestamp), assert only the FIXED text around it — for a work note reading "Problem PRB0012345 created", assert " created". To prove a field is merely set, put ISNOTEMPTY in the locator and assert a field whose value you know.
6c. Never assert a field that is not in the REAL SCHEMA below, and never assume a value for a field the live context reports as EMPTY on this instance — an effect that depends on an empty field produces nothing here, so asserting a made-up value fails a correct flow.
7. cleanup MUST include the setup record ({ "bySetupRecord": true }) plus every record the flow creates.
8. Keep setup.payload minimal: only what the trigger condition requires, plus a short_description so the record is identifiable.
9. DERIVED FIELDS — critical. On task tables (incident, problem, change_request, sc_task) "priority" is CALCULATED from "impact" and "urgency". Writing priority directly is silently overwritten on insert: {"priority":"1"} lands as 4 - Low. To create a P1 record set {"impact":"1","urgency":"1"} and do NOT set priority at all. The same applies to any field the platform computes — set the inputs, not the result.
10. setup.payload must make the trigger condition TRUE after the platform's own rules run, not merely look like it. If the trigger tests a calculated field, drive it through the fields it is calculated from.
10b. RECORD-UPDATED TRIGGERS. Read the trigger out of the source. If it is trigger.record.updated (not .created / .createdOrUpdated), an insert can NEVER fire it — the flow only runs on a transition. Split setup in two:
    - "payload" creates the record OUTSIDE the trigger condition (do not satisfy the condition here);
    - "update" is the patch that moves it INTO the trigger condition, and that is what fires the flow.
    Rule 9 still applies to BOTH halves: to reach Critical priority put {"impact":"1","urgency":"1"} in the half that needs it and never write "priority" directly.
    Rule 3 also applies to both: a field written by "update" cannot be asserted on the setup record.
    Use "update" ONLY for an updated trigger. For a created trigger, omit it — a created flow fires on the insert and an extra update proves nothing.
11b. SLA ASSERTIONS. If the request promises that a record gets an SLA — a response or resolution clock, a breach time — assert it with { "type": "sla" } rather than by reading fields. It resolves the named contract_sla, finds the task_sla row that references THAT DEFINITION on the setup record, and checks the breach clock. Two rules:
    - Name the definition exactly. Asserting "a task_sla exists" proves nothing: this instance attaches its own out-of-box SLAs to the same record, and one P1 incident was measured attaching THREE rows. The assertion is "this definition attached", never "an SLA attached".
    - State expect.plannedEndToleranceSec yourself. The clock starts when the platform attaches the row, not when the runner posted the record, so the two differ by however long the insert took. 120 is a sensible value; a tolerance nobody can see in the spec is a number nobody can review.
    Do NOT hand-assert planned_end_time with a field assertion. Those times are stored in UTC and rendered to the session timezone, and a literal comparison against either half fails a correct SLA.

11. PAUSING FLOWS. If the source contains askForApproval (or any wait), the flow STOPS there and everything after it has not run yet. Split the assertions:
    - "assert" holds only what is true while paused. For an approval this MUST prove WHO the approval was raised for, not merely that one exists: assert the "approver" field of the sysapproval_approver row (locate by "document_id={{setup.sys_id}}") against the approver's display name from the live context. Asserting only state="requested" is too weak — an approval routed to the wrong person would pass it.
    - "resume" describes the state change that unblocks it: patch the sysapproval_approver row to {"state":"approved"}.
    - "assertAfterResume" holds the effects that follow approval (the work note, the field update).
    Putting a post-approval effect in "assert" is wrong — it has not happened yet and the run will fail a correct flow.`;

Every excuse is CHECKED against the live instance: if the field turns out to exist, or the value turns out to be non-empty, the excuse is rejected and you must check the effect instead.
1. inputs is a CONTRACT, not prose. Use exactly the input names listed under SUBFLOW CONTRACT below — every mandatory one, and nothing that is not on the list. An undeclared input is dropped by the runner, so the call would prove something other than what you wrote.

 * Unsatisfiable promises — the verified escape hatch (CLASS D fix)

 * Two guards used to contradict each other, and no model could satisfy both:
 *
 *   - the field-existence check told the model "`incident.problem` does not
 *     exist here, so DROP that assertion rather than faking it";
 *   - the coverage rule then rejected the result for writing fewer assertions
 *     than the request had promised effects.
 *
 * Measured live (§20): the model obeyed the first, was punished by the second,
 * and both remaining attempts re-sent the identical spec. A5 caught the loop
 * and named it correctly as OUR defect.
 *
 * The fix is not to weaken coverage. A promise may be excused ONLY if the model
 * says which promise, why, and in a form this code can CHECK against the live
 * instance. An unproven excuse is rejected exactly like an unproven assertion —
 * otherwise the hatch becomes a way to quietly assert nothing, which is the
 * false green all over again, wearing different clothes.
