 * for itself: the run's single time anchor, the instance client, the per-run
 * read cache (so two rules declaring the same read cost one request), the
 * capability probes (cached), the parameter registry, and a scratch space
 * for engine-built structures that other engines reuse (the relationship
 * graph, the CI×time index, resolved group memberships, rule results).
 *
 * `client` is injectable for the offline suite; the default is the one funnel
 * every read in this app goes through.
