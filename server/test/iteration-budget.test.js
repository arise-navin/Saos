/**
 * F12 — the iteration budget, said out loud, and said EPHEMERALLY.
 *
 *   node --test server/test/
 *
 * THE DEFECT. The agent loop stops after a fixed number of LLM calls, and the
 * model can see neither the cap, nor how many calls it has spent, nor how many
 * remain. Every instruction of the form "wrap up cleanly as you approach the
 * cap" was therefore unexecutable — it asked the model to act on a quantity it
 * has no access to.
 *
 * Live 2026-08-24 is the bill for that. A phase turn died on iteration 15 of
 * 15 with sys_ids resolved but never saved and no report of what had been
 * done. `remember_fact` spends an iteration like any other tool call, so the
 * turn that is diligent about persisting what it learned hits the cap SOONER.
 *
 * Two halves, and the second is the one with teeth:
 *
 *   1. the notice appears in the outbound system prompt exactly when three or
 *      fewer calls remain, and says something the model can act on;
 *   2. it is EPHEMERAL — it never touches a history row, and it never reaches
 *      the digest builder. A stale "only 1 call remains", folded into a
 *      summary, is a lie told to every later turn in the session.
