/**
 * PHASE 18 — WHAT CHANGE INTELLIGENCE CANNOT DO, COUNTED RATHER THAN PROMISED.
 *
 * `agent/change/` answers one question — what is different between two states
 * of a flow, and what could it cost — and the whole design rests on it having
 * no way to do anything else. §32 says analysis is read-only. §59 says it never
 * deploys. §54 says the model does not decide a diff. §63.1 makes an invented
 * baseline a release blocker. Every one of those is a claim about ABSENCE, and
 * absence is the property that rots silently: the module that grows a
 * `deploy()` next spring will still pass every behavioural test in this build,
 * right up to the afternoon it writes to production.
 *
 * So the checks below read the source off disk and count. The pattern is Phase
 * 17's, deliberately: an exact allowlist of every edge that leaves the
 * directory fails on ANY new one, including the edge nobody thought to forbid,
 * where a blocklist only ever catches what its author already imagined.
 *
 * The handful of behavioural checks that follow are the ones a static read
 * cannot make — that a diff run twice is the same diff, that two states whose
 * keys were written in different orders hash the same, that `readState` refuses
 * a source nobody could read again. No instance, no database, no model: every
 * fact here is true on any machine that has the repository.
 *
 * And because a guard nobody has watched fail is a guard nobody has tested, T12
 * runs every detector in this file against text that violates its property AND
 * against real lines from `agent/change/` that must not trip it.
