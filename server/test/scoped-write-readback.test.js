/*
 * ── THE M-1 CLASS, ENFORCED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * M-1 was not a one-off. Its shape:
 *
 *   A script dispatched through the execution harness runs in this
 *   APPLICATION'S SCOPE (a sysauto_script created over the Table API is born in
 *   the REST session's current application, and the scope cannot be overridden
 *   on the insert — trap #69). A scoped script writing to a table owned by
 *   `global` has its field writes DISCARDED IN SILENCE: `canWrite()` answers
 *   true, `setValue` is a no-op, `insert()` returns a real sys_id and
 *   `getLastErrorMessage()` is null. Every signal reports success and the row
 *   lands empty.
 *
 * MEASURED Application Access on the tables NHA writes this way:
 *
 *   sys_user_preference   create=true   update=FALSE   <- M-1's own sink
 *   sys_update_set        create=true   update=FALSE
 *   sys_security_acl      create=false  update=false
 *   sys_dictionary        create=false  update=false
 *
 * "create=true, update=false" is exactly the shape that produces a row with no
 * fields in it. So a sys_id proves nothing, and the only defence that works is
 * to READ THE WRITE BACK — preferably over a different transport from the one
 * that made it, so a fabricated id, a no-op insert, or a report belonging to
 * another execution all fail.
 *
 * This test is the sweep, kept executable. Every module that dispatches a
 * server-side script containing a write must appear in the registry below with
 * the read-back that guards it. A NEW one cannot be added without deciding —
 * and writing down — how its write is proven. That is the whole point: M-1
 * leaked 11 rows across sessions precisely because one infrastructure write had
 * no read-back and nobody had to say so.
